# PathPlanner Integration Guide

This document explains how the **PathPlanner** tool connects to our Python code.

## 📂 Where are the files?
PathPlanner saves all your work (paths, autos, robot settings) as **JSON files** inside the `deploy/pathplanner` folder. You generally **do not** edit these files manually; you use the PathPlanner GUI app.

---

## 1. Loading Robot Settings (`subsystems/drivesubsystem.py`)
The code needs to know physical properties of the robot (Max Speed, Wheel Base, Weight) to drive accurately.

*   **Location**: `subsystems/drivesubsystem.py` inside `configurePathPlanner()`
*   **The Code**:
    ```python
    config = RobotConfig.fromGUISettings()
    ```
*   **What it does**: It looks for the robot configuration JSON file generated by the GUI and loads those numbers.

## 2. Loading Auto Paths (`robotcontainer.py`)
The code needs to find all the autonomous routines you created so you can select them before a match.

*   **Location**: `robotcontainer.py` inside `configureAutos()`
*   **The Code**:
    ```python
    self.chosenAuto = AutoBuilder.buildAutoChooser()
    ```
*   **What it does**: It scans the `deploy/pathplanner/autos` folder, finds every routine, and creates a **SendableChooser** (dropdown menu) that appears on the SmartDashboard/Shuffleboard.

## 🛠️ How to Make Changes
1.  Open the **PathPlanner** desktop application.
2.  **To change speed/size**: Go to the "Robot Config" tab in the app.
3.  **To change paths**: Draw new paths or edit existing ones in the "Automations" tab.
4.  **Deploy**: Click the "Deploy" button (or copy the files to the `deploy/` folder manually).
5.  **Restart Code**: The robot code only reads these files when it starts up. You must restart the robot code to see changes!
